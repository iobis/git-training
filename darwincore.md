# Introduction to Darwin Core

## What is Darwin Core (DwC)?

If you're not already familiar with DwC, it is body of standards (i.e., identifiers, labels, definitions) to facilitate sharing biodiversity information. It provides stable terms and vocabularies related to biological objects, data, and their collection. DwC is maintained by [TDWG](https://www.tdwg.org/) (Biodiversity Information Standards, formerly The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases). Stable terms and vocabularies ensure that datasets in OBIS have consistently interpretable fields. By following Darwin Core standards, both data providers and users know exactly the definition of various fields and can interpret quality of data easier.

A key resource to bookmark is the [Darwin Core Quick Reference Guide](https://dwc.tdwg.org/terms/), which contains a list with definitions of all current Darwin Core vocabularies. We'll return to this later.

## Data files and the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A)

Datasets can come in many different formats and file arrangements for all the different types of data - one spreadsheet, multiple sheets, many files, etc. This can of course make interpreting different datasets difficult where data might be in different places. Fortunately Darwin Core includes guidelines for dataset structure! The basic structure includes at minimum one core data file, with the possibility for additional "extension" files. For datasets published to OBIS there are two options for a core file: 1) Occurrence core or 2) Event core

Below we outline the different options there are for publishing datasets to OBIS:
